        <li>3 Tablespoons plus 1/4 cup (105ml) extra virgin olive oil, divided</li>
        <li>2 medium cloves garlic, minced (about 2 teaspoons)</li>
        <li>3 cups hearty bread cut into 3/4 inch cubes</li>
        <li>2 ounces finely grated parmesan cheese (about 1cup), divided</li>
        <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 large egg yolk</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon (15ml) juice from 1 lemon</li>
        <li>2 to 6 anchovies (see note)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon (5ml) Worcestershire sauce (see note)</li>
        <li>2 heads romaine lettuce, inner leaves only, washed and carefully dried, large 
            leaves torn into smaller pieces, smaller leaves left intact
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p></p>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat oven to 375°F (190°C). In a small bowl, combine 3 tablespoons (45ml) olive oil with minced garlic and whisk for 30 seconds. Transfer to a fine-mesh strainer set over a large bowl and press with the back of a spoon to extract as much oil as possible, leaving garlic behind. Reserve pressed garlic separately. Add bread cubes to garlic oil and toss to coat.</li>
        <li>Add 2 tablespoons Parmesan cheese, toss again, and season to taste with salt and pepper. Transfer to a rimmed baking sheet. Bake until croutons are pale golden brown and crisp, about 15 minutes. Remove from oven and toss with 2 more tablespoons Parmesan. Allow to cool.</li>
        <li>While croutons bake, make the dressing. Combine egg yolk, lemon juice, anchovies, Worcestershire sauce, pressed garlic, and 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese in the bottom of a cup that just fits the head of an immersion blender or in the bottom of a food processor. With blender or processor running, slowly drizzle in canola oil until a smooth emulsion forms. Transfer mixture to a medium bowl. Whisking constantly, slowly drizzle in remaining 1/4 cup (60ml) extra-virgin olive oil. Season to taste generously with salt and pepper. </li>
        <li>To serve, toss lettuce with a few tablespoons of dressing, adding more if desired. Once lettuce is coated, add half of remaining cheese and three-quarters of croutons and toss again. Transfer to a salad bowl and sprinkle with remaining cheese and croutons. Serve.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Notes</h3>
    <p>The amounts of Worcestershire sauce and anchovies used can be varied according to taste. This recipe will make more dressing than you need for four servings. Extra dressing can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.</p>
